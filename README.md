# Project/Research details:
this project is amid to apply convolutional neural network (CNN) with the Augmentation technique to identify the different categories of Lung Cancer **_Non-Small Cell._**
there are three categories to be identified in my research:
+ Normal ----> no tumor.
+ Adeno -----> Adenocarcinoma.
+ Carcinoma -----> Large cell carcinoma.

* note: the Squamous cell carcinoma was not included due to scarcity of the data.

* note: I provided to similar codes: one for google colab and the other is on my own machine because I was willing to understand the difference in code and processing power.

# Suggestions: 
there are few recommendation to make the model more generalized for more categories of the lung cancer or even any other cancer (As it is suited in a pipeline format like)
+ find a dataset for the **_Small Cell Lung Cancer_**
+ increase the number of neural networks.
+ trian on Google Colab or any Super computer.
